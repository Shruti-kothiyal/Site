            Bleeding profusely, Rengoku, Akaza, and our two spectators Tanjiro and Inosuke quickly realized that this Flame Hashira's 
            end was near, prompting Akaza to essentially beg for Rengoku to abandon his human body and become a demon who can 
            heal one-hundred times over. Akaza's desire made Rengoku recall a bittersweet memory of his mother who brought him up to 
            believe that he was blessed with strong abilities to protect other people rather than bring harm. With this memory in mind, 
            Rengoku's human spirit was set ablaze one final time.
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            Trapping Akaza's hand in his impaled body as the sun rose was Rengoku's last-ditch effort in protecting his fellow 
            demon slayers from this blood-thirsty foe. Here, our Flame Hashira held to the demon for dear life, hoping that the sun 
            would put an end to his existence. In addition to this, Tanjiro and Inosuke finally saw an opening to assist their comrade, 
            but, unfortunately, both of these efforts would prove to be futile as Akaza didn't want to perish just yet.
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            Desparate, Akaza broke his arms away from Rengoku's body and made a run for it but not before Tanjiro launched 
            his sword into the demon's body, screaming at the top of his lungs, “Don't run away! The Demon Slayers are always fighting you 
            demons in the dark of the night where you have the advantage! You're the one who lost! It's Rengoku who won!”
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            Shortly after his boisterous declarations, Rengoku called Tanjiro close to relay to him his final wishes.
        </div>  
        <div class="para">
            The first is to read the letters left by the previous Flame Hashira to see if there is any information about Tanjiro's father's 
            Hinokami Kagura dance. The second, to visit Rengoku's little brother, Senjuro, and tell him to follow the path his heart desires. 
            The third, to tell his father to take care of himself, and the last, to live his life with his head held high, allowing no one 
            to dim his heart as he strives to become a Hashira of the Demon Slayer Corps.
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            As his final minutes arrived, Rengoku saw a figment of his late mother. As she stood there in a glowing white, he asked her if 
            he fulfilled his duties to protect the weak. With a smile on her face, she answered, “You made me proud”. 
            This made Rengoku bear his final smile. Soon after, he passed away, joining his mother in the land of the dead.
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            In front of his deceased body, Tanjiro lamented about his frustrations about not being strong enough to protect everyone. 
            Taken aback by the many walls that stand in front of him just when he just managed to overcome great obstacles. 
            Tears continued flowing down his face and Zenitsu joined him in his wallowing, but Inosuke couldn't stand the whining, 
            urging Tanjiro and Zenitsu to cease their tears and to keep living up to Rengoku's standards. Ironically and expectedly, 
            Inosuke couldn't stop the tears from flowing either. Neither could we.
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            Episode ends with the news of Rengoku's death being told to all of the Hashiras and by each of their reactions, 
            we can tell that this Flame Hashira's death would change the course of this story drastically.
