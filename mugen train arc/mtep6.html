            “Move Forward!” began with the awakening of Inosuke, one of the three allies Tanjiro desperately needed to awaken to come to his aid.
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            This sixth episode started off with Tanjiro and his boar head-wearing comrade Inosuke successfully slaying Enmu, 
            the demon in charge of the deadly Mugen Train.
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            Naturally, this fight did not end without any harm done to our young demon slayers, specifically with Tanjiro 
            who was unexpectedly impaled with a sharp object by the deranged conductor. Seeing his friend injured, Inosuke, initially, 
            wanted to do away with the conductor and focus on getting himself and the rest of his comrades to safety, but, thankfully, 
            our sweet-natured Tanjiro convinced Inosuke that abandoning these innocent humans who already suffered so much was not the way.
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            With this newfound sense of duty, Inosuke went on to help the individuals on the Mugen Train, leaving the wounded 
            Tanjiro by himself—but not for long.
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            Rengoku quickly arrived to reassure Tanjior that all passengers were able to escape with their lives and to also 
            teach him how to slow his breathing to avoid bleeding out. However, while our Flame Hashira was being a great big brother
             to this young demon slayer, a new enemy appeared; one that would prove to be nearly one-hundred times stronger than Enmu.
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            This blue-striped powerful demon approached Rengoku with only one goal in mind: to convert our righteous Flame Hashira 
            into an unbridled demon who would spar with him until the end of time. This, while a kind gesture in the upper-rank demon's eyes, 
            was a huge insult to Rengoku who quickly declined his offer. But, of course, doing so did not come without consequences. 
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            Akaza did not hesitate to exchange blows with Rengoku and, fortunately, Rengoku did not hesitate to return the favor. 
            These two skilled fighters battled faster than the speed of light. So fast that those wanting to join the fight to help 
            this Hashira (Insouke and Tanjiro) knew that they would, unfortunately, only get in the way.
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            Desparate to end this fight, both Rengoku and Akaza pulled out their very best finishing moves; 
            Akaza with his Destructive Death Disorder and Rengoku with his Fifth Form Flame Tiger. Both doing everything they can 
            to obtain that which they desire, however, in the end, it seems as though Rengoku's power fell short.
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            We end the episode not knowing whether or not Rengoku will survive Akaza's final blow, however, 
            we are more than prepared to see the outcome no matter who comes out victorious.
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            All in all, it goes without saying that this episode was a masterpiece and did this epic showdown justice. 
            Though we're nearly at the end, Demon Slayer consistently delivers new episodes full of action, heartbreak, and 
            characters who we've grown to appreciate dearly.
