        <div class="para">
            We start this second episode with our rowdy yet loveable trio of demon slayers consisting of Tanjiro Kamado, 
            Zenitsu Agatsuma, and Inosuke Hashibira; the latter of who is overly enthused about being on a magical train. 
            Hilariously navigating through each car of the train, the three are blown away by Flame Hashira Kyojuro Rengoku's screams of “delicious” 
            after every bite of his flavorful bento box. 
            There, they meet the man who will change the course of their lives forever.
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            Shortly after meeting this esteemed demon slayer, Tanjiro asks for more information about his late father. 
            More specifically, he asks if he can give any insight into the fiery Hinokami Kagura dance that both he and his father 
            managed to incorporate into battle. 
            Unfortunately, Rengoku is not very knowledgeable on this topic but still vows to take Tanjiro under his wing as a mentee, 
            which would certainly come in handy for the evil that awaited them shortly.
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            With lights flickering and an awful smell lingering throughout the vehicle, it has now become clear that the quartet 
            are not heading towards the danger, but are already in the presence of it as they come across their first two demons of the night. 
            Rengoku swiftly deals with the demons and, naturally, looks insanely cool while doing it. 
            Here, he also teaches the trio their first lesson: to prioritize the lives of human beings above all else. 
            Of course, the lads are blown away by how cool this Flame Hashira is and go on to, lovingly, call him their big brother. 
            However, these moments of glee would soon disappear once they enter a long slumber brought upon the mysterious conductor 
            punching their train tickets earlier in the episode.
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            The real threat has officially arrived.
            In deep sleep, the demon slayers are unaware that Muzan Kibutsuji's lower level demon is the one orchestrating everything 
            including their dreams that feel extremely close to reality. 
            The lower-level demon, Enmu, plans to have all the passengers pass away in their sleep, 
            believing that it is one of the luckiest ways to depart from the Earth.
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            Luck is most certainly needed as these four demon slayers currently show no sign of waking up despite being tied to 
            four mysterious children while resting. Their sweet dreams have gotten the best of them as, during slumber, 
            they dream of being reunited with their loved ones once more. Falling deeper and deeper into this trance, subconsciously, 
            they must believe that their blissful dreams are much better than reality, and thus, they have no desire to awaken.
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            With all this said, it goes without saying that episode 2 did a great job in setting up the tensions that would 
            be seen throughout the third and possibly 
            fourth episode of the anime series, which is certainly exciting for fans everywhere.
        </div>
        <div class="para">Even still, it's hard to not recognize that the indistinguishable resemblance between the scenes shown
             in this episode and the scenes shown in the aforementioned film despite there being one or two moments that we may not have seen in the movie.
              Perhaps more new scenes will be seen in the remainder of the series and we'll get to delve more into the meaning behind Rengoku Kyojuro'
              s dreams. After all, the Mugen Train Arc does heavily revolve around this
             Flame Hashira and it would be slightly disappointing if we didn't get to know more about him.</div>
