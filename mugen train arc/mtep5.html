        <div class="para">
            “Move Forward!” began with the awakening of Inosuke, one of the three allies Tanjiro desperately needed to awaken to come to his aid.
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            Inosuke, in all his might, blasted through the roofs of the train, quickly receiving orders from Tanjiro to protect 
            the sleeping passengers in his respective train car as Nezuko fights against Enmu's tentacle-like arms in her car. 
            However, Enmu's ability allows him to regenerate as quickly as possible, leaving Nezuko open to attack from the other 
            tentacles near her; that is until her number one fan soon awakened.
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            After a long slumber, Zenitsu finally awakened with protecting Nezuko as the only goal on his mind. 
            With his lightning and thunder, this demon slayer cut through many of Enmu's arms, leaving him unable to regenerate 
            for a substantial amount of time. Though helpful, this still was not enough. The demon slayers as well as the passengers 
            of the train needed someone insanely strong to come to their aid; someone with the mental prowess to come up with a solid
             plan to defeat Enmu; someone like Rengoku. And Rengoku they received.
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            Hilariously ashamed that he was too busy sleeping to outwit the plans of Enmu, Rengoku burst into action, 
            sending the train full of Enmu's body parts into flame. He then quickly tasked Tanjiro and the others with a 
            comprehensive mission to defeat Enmu while also protecting those still asleep on the train. 
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            Now motivated more than ever to put a stop to this deadly train, Tanjiro along with Inosuke sought after the 
            true head of Enmu in an effort to decapitate him. This, of course, didn't prove to be so easy as Enmu used dirty tricks, 
            such as constantly putting Tanjiro to sleep once he locked eyes with a lower-rank demon eye, to avoid being found. 
            Unable to close his eyes when he would awaken from his sleep, Tanjiro was quickly defeated each time. 
            But, thanks to a boar-wearing Inosuke, Enmu's plans became null and void, leaving the upper hand in the demon slayers' hands.
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            In the end, Enmu was finally defeated after Inosuke and Tanjiro teamed together to find his head and 
            detach it from the rest of the train as well as his body. But with this foe defeated and the arc not yet concluded, 
            we already know that this fight is far from over.
