            The third episode of the Assassins-Slayer Mugen Train Arc,Should Have Been, finally begins diving into the meat of the story, 
            taking us through the idyllic dreams that the demon have built.  
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            This is a slower episode, which is already mostly made up of footage from the Mugen Train film. 
            There were no new notable scenes I could spot. It's an emotional episode that brings us through characters dream. 
            From Zenitsus fantasy with Nezuko to a gut-wrenching reunion with his family.

            The monster's skull, a monster, and a bear bear are the main characters.

            It's a comic relief for the show, but one of my only complaints with the movie “Mugen Train” was its little development. 
            While the two characters dream are hilarious, it is so strange to open their comical scenes and then move towards a truly 
            emotional one with Rengoku and Tanjiro. The stinger at the end of the episode, like the earlier episode, 
            remains a significant way to add to the story. 
            Of course, the only difference was what they chose to show this week.

        <div class="para">
            A single thing that can be said for now is that episodic can really make cliffhangers, 
            and this episode's end is on one of the greatest horror scenes of the movie. 
            I think the format does naive for the plot, but I can't imagine it would have been better for a week 
            if you didn't know what the movie was.

            After all, Episode 3 could have done with some revamped pacing, as this time around, the events appear to drag on a bit. 
            The film didn't show that much of an event as it slipped into action with no winner. 
            Like I said earlier, I appreciate the more dramatic sense of the ending, but that's what was more subdued time.
