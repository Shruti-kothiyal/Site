        <div class="para">
            The fourth episode of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba Mugen Train Arc, "Insult", was a testament to Tanjiro's willpower. 
            It is also the most triggering moment in Demon Slayer yet. 
            Tanjiro has found a way to wake up and is not about to let Enmu continue tainting the memory of his family. 
            I feel like this is the one demon we have not seen any redeeming past moments or qualities whatsoever.

        <div class="para">
            Tanjiro's vision of his dad has appeared and advises him to take up his sword as there is something he must cut. 
            Right away Tanjiro realizes what it is, and while I had seen it in the film and read it in the manga, it still does not 
            take away from how impactful this scene is. Tanjiro puts aside his own dream in hopes this will put an end to this distorted 
            reality all while the kid who was tied up to him is shown the vastness and warmth of Tanjiro's heart. 
            It really did a fine job of demonstrating who Tanjiro really is and how this very self-awareness renders Enmu's powers 
            useless while facing our shonen hero. 
            I also found it particularly amusing, the contrast between his subconsciousness against Zenitsu's and Inosuke's and 
            how dark it was there.

        <div class="para">
            Once again, I love the visuals to Demon Slayer so muchâ€” the initial confrontation between Enmu and Tanjiro was visually 
            impressive and leaves you wanting more action, as often their battles do. There is something visually stunning about having the elements 
            dance along during combat. However, the battle against Rui in the first season really sets the bar high, so you already 
            know there will be more magical effects coming our way.
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            Not much really happened on this episode as it leads to the next part of the battle: our heroes waking up and raging against the machine, 
            the Mugen Train, who has now become Enmu's blood, flesh, and bone. 
            The real fight is about to start and even though we have already seen the film it does not make it any less anxiety-inducing.
