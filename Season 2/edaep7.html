            Demon Slayer: Entertainment District Arc Episode 7 continues the trend of increasing the emotional and physical stakes of 
            Demon Slayer to the highest peaks of the series to date. Nezuko has achieved her new demon form during the battle against Daki, 
            but has she passed the point of no return or will Tanjiro still be able to save her?
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            The most important storyline throughout Demon Slayer has been Tanjiro’s quest to save Nezuko and return her to human form. 
            His endeavor to do so has had him go up against some of the toughest challenges in order to convince the human world that 
            Nezuko isn’t a threat, and that she can be saved. Every time Nezuko is shown fighting, she is fighting to protect Tanjiro 
            and the other humans around her. There has never been any sign that she can’t be saved, until now.

            During her transformation in her fight against Daki, Nezuko reaches a level of power and bloodlust that even Tanjiro 
            struggles to keep in check. This struggle in Demon Slayer: Entertainment District Arc Episode 7 shows Tanjiro at his most desperate,
             and there is a real feeling that he might lose his beloved sister. I won’t spoil what happens specifically here, but the emotional 
             stakes are incredible high and the scenes between the two siblings, including some well-done flashbacks, had me on the verge of tears.

            While the emotional parts of Demon Slayer are vital, the fight scenes are where the series has consistently set itself apart from 
            the rest of the shonen genre. Demon Slayer: Entertainment District Arc Episode 7 is no different, especially when we get a better 
            look at some of Nezuko’s new demon abilities. The fight with Daki does come to an end in this episode, however, and a new threat 
            emerges. It turns out Daki has a brother, Gyutaro, who appears to be the real reason Daki is considered an Upper Rank demon. 
            Uzui even mentions that Daki is not a real threat, and we see why as soon as Gyutaro hits the stage.

        <div class="para">
            Gyutaro, as portrayed in Demon Slayer: Entertainment District Arc Episode 7, is arguably one of the most dangerous 
            villains in the entire Demon Slayer series so far (with Enmu from the Mugen Train movie holding the number one spot for now). 
            His sickles are downright frightening, and he clearly poses an extreme threat. Thankfully, Tanjiro is reunited with Inosuke 
            and Zenitsu as the bigger battle with Gyutaro comes to a head. It feels like the gang has no chance of helping Uzui defeat 
            Gyutaro, which has me looking forward to the next episode even more.
