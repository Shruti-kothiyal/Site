            Demon Slayer's Entertainment District Arc Episode 2 continues ufotable's adaptation of one of my personal favorite Demon Slayer 
            story arcs by finally bringing us to the legendary Entertainment District. After the introduction of the Sound Hashira Tenzen Uzui, 
            Tanjiro and the gang appear to be in a bit over their heads when they offer to go with Uzui.

        <div class="para">
            Right off the bat in Entertainment District Arc Episode 2 we see that Uzui is clearly less likeable and less respected 
            than previous Hashira we have seen in the series. He introduces himself as the “God of Festivals”, and only Inosuke takes 
            him at his word. Tanjiro and Zenitsu are both immediately skeptical of Uzui, and they believe him to be just as crazy as 
            their boar-headed friend. This dynamic is quite intriguing, since Tanjiro specifically has always seem captivated by the Hashira 
            in his previous encounters. The fact that both him and Zenitsu were not immediately awestruck could set up for some really 
            interesting interactions going forward.

            While Uzui might not have blown any of the three away at first, the same cannot be said for the Entertainment District. 
            As soon as they enter, Tanjiro, Zenitsu, and Inosuke are blown away by how big and bright the Entertainment District is. 
            It is a jarring difference from the small towns and more traditional settings that they have experienced so far throughout the series. 
            Tanjiro comments that the city looks like it is in the middle of the day when they arrive, 
            even though it is clearly nighttime when they enter. The fish out of water feeling for all three of them puts them at a 
            disadvantage right from the start, which is likely going to make their mission more difficult in future episodes.

            I would be remiss if I didn't mention that the Entertainment District looks as vibrant visually to the viewers as 
            it feels to the characters in the show. The already brilliant animation of Demon Slayer really brings the city to live. 
            The bustling crowds and business of a large city are really felt visually, and I almost felt as overwhelmed as the main characters. 
            The wonderful animation and art design really helps show how different the Entertainment District is from anything else our 
            heroes have encountered before.
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            The Entertainment District is mainly known for being more of a “red-light district”, which is coincidental what the Japanese 
            title of the episode (yuukaku) refers to it as. The main focus here is on brothels, and Uzui quickly informs the trio that 
            they will be searching for his three wives who have infiltrated different brothel houses in search of more information about 
            the demon threat. What he doesn't tell them, until it's too late, is that they will have to go in some very interesting disguises. 
            Typically I would find an anime storyline focused around brothels and prostitution to feel too much like fan service, 
            the historical context here makes it feel a bit more organic. The “men dressing as women” gag itself does feel pretty outdated though.
