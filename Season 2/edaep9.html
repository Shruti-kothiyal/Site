            Demon Slayer: Entertainment District Arc Episode 9 continues the fight against Daki and Gyutaro, the Upper Rank 6 demons. 
            The battle has been incredible fierce so far, will Tanjiro and friends be able to come away victorious?

            As the title implies, Demon Slayer: Entertainment District Arc Episode 9 is all about defeating the Upper Rank demons. 
            While the battle on the Mugen Train was intense and challenging, fighting against the Upper Rank is on an entirely different scale. 
            We have seen glimpses of Daki and Gyutaro's powers already, but Episode 9 really drives home just how deadly they are. 
            One of the things I have appreciated most about this season is how they have been able to scale the challenge up and give it 
            a real life-or-death feel. Everyone expects Tanjiro to find a way to defeat them, with the help of Nezuko, Uzui, Zenitsu, 
            and Inosuke as well as Uzui's wives. What is not easy to see, however, is how that is going to be possible.

            The threat of the Upper Rank demons and the effort it takes to defeat them really shines in the incredible animation from ufotable. 
            If it seems like I just keep writing “the animation is incredible” every week, it is simply because it is true. 
            The breathtaking animation of the different attacks from both the heroes and the villains should be a case study on how 
            to create anime fight scenes for decades to come. 
            I'm not even exaggerating, the visual quality of the Entertainment District Arc is really that good. 
            In Episode 9 specifically I found myself genuinely threatened by Gyutaro. He looks like pure evil, and the way he is able to 
            overcome the most powerful attacks from Uzui is astounding.

        <div class="para">
            More important than the visual aspect of the show is the top notch storytelling. Episode 8 gave a deeper look at Uzui, 
            and Episode 9 continues that while also giving more backstory to his wives. These flashback scenes fit perfectly in between 
            the breathtaking action, and give added weight to the ongoing fight. The attention to detail in crafting stories for even the 
            side characters is part of why Demon Slayer sets itself apart from other shonen anime. I was able to feel Uzui's concern for 
            his wives as they were in danger, but not because they are weak and unable to protect themselves. Instead, knowing their 
            motivations and goals made them interesting enough for me to want to see them succeed. That is excellent storytelling, and 
            I am grateful this episode took the time to explore it more.
