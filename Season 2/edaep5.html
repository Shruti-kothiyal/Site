            Demon Slayer: Entertainment District Arc Episode 5 sees Tanjiro continue his battle with the Upper-Rank Demon. 
            Even as his battle rages, however, the others are just as busy as Inosuke closes in on his opponent. 
            Can the Demon Slayers hold their own against these powerful enemies?

            This episode opens with Tengen as he searches the entertainment district for any sign of the demon who has been plaguing 
            the area or his wives. Luckily, his search is not vain as he quickly stumbles upon some critical information. 
            This opening works well as it immediately sets a great tone for this episode's place in the arc. 
            After several episodes of stumbling in the dark as they search for their prey, Entertainment District Arc Episode 5 
            instantly lets the viewer know things are changing from here.

            After this opening, the story returns to Tanjiro as he fights the upper-rank demon. 
            This battle's moments are interwoven with a fair amount of retrospective on the part of Tanjiro. 
            As he struggles to keep up with his opponent he has to come to terms with some of his limitations and push himself beyond 
            his normal boundaries.

            While I enjoyed most of this sequence, there is a fair amount of oddly placed humor that doesn't work for me. 
            The life or death struggle that Tanjiro faces, as well as his internal conflict, don't lend themselves to the abrasive 
            humor that breaks up some of these moments.

            The last big element of Entertainment District Arc Episode 5 is Inosuke's. 
            As he continues to hunt down the demon he hears in the floor and the walls he makes a startling discovery. 
            No spoilers, but this surprise came out of left field on me. 
            While it brings an interesting element to the narrative, it also allows for a unique sequence of action as Inosuke 
            must confront the surprising nature of his foe.
