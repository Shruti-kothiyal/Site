            Demon Slayer: Entertainment District Arc Episode 4 sees Tanjiro close in on the demon that has been preying upon 
            the entertainment district. But even as he closes in, the others continue to follow their leads toward their query. 
            Who will find the demon first? And will they be able to survive the confrontation when they do?

            This week's episode opens with a heartwarming moment between Miss Koinatsu and two of her young charges. 
            This exchange brings the episode in with a bit of light-heartedness, which helps contrast it from the darker tones that 
            the last episode closed on. Its playful energy gets the story moving nicely and provides a smooth transition into the heart 
            of Entertainment District Arc Episode 4's story. From here we see Tanjiro, Inosuke, and Uzui meeting up to learn how each's 
            investigation is going. Tanjiro is disturbed to learn that Zenitsu has not been seen recently. Suspecting that he has run 
            afoul of their prey, Tanjiro and Inosuke decide to team up when night falls to finish their hunt while there may yet be time 
            to save their comrade. The back half of the episode sees nightfall as the demon slayers begin to make their moves. 
            The tones for this part of the episode take a darker turn as one of the team finds themself far closer to their prey than they expected.

            Where this episode ends its search for the demon is a pleasant surprise for me. 
            Having struggled through some drawn-out Shonen story arcs lately, I was happy to see this storyline not following suit, 
            but rather moving along at a good clip since both the situation and the antagonist have already been so skillfully realized.

            While overall, Entertainment District Arc Episode 4 delivers a solid story it isn't without its faults. 
            There are moments during the demon slayer's meeting that devolve into outright obnoxiousness which hampered my enjoyment 
            of the planning session. Aside from this momentary struggle, however, the show brought manages to bring an impressive array 
            of elements and tones throughout its run time that it brings together smoothly and harmoniously. My only other complaint with 
            this episode is a personal one. The continued absence of Nezumo. While the situations contained within this story make her 
            continued reclusion in her box sensible, I wish my favorite character in the series could get a little bit of screen time.
