            With Demon Slayer: Entertainment District Arc Episode 8, the series' most impressive arc to date is finally reaching its climax. 
            Daki and Gyutaro are the toughest test Tanjiro and friends have had to face yet, and it's going to take everything they 
            have to defeat these Upper Rank demons.

            Some of the most interesting moments of Demon Slayer are when Tanjiro and Nezuko take a backseat, and Demon Slayer: 
            Entertainment District Arc Episode 8 is no exception. Instead of focusing on the brother and sister duo, 
            the main storyline focuses on Uzui and his history. He was always a fascinating character just from a visual perspective, 
            and his flashy demeanor absolutely stands out, but his backstory helps fully flesh him out. Uzui initially comes across as an 
            absolute fucboi, but his development across the season so far has peeled back the layers around him. Not only does he care deeply 
            for his wives, but he also learns to put his upbringing behind him in order to focus on saving others. 
            There is a line about how he feels like he can never measure up to Rengoku, which is one of the most heartwarming moments of the series. 
            Stick around after the credits too and you'll see a little more context added to that line, which you won't want to miss.

            Demon Slayer: Entertainment District Arc Episode 8 isn't only focused on character development though. 
            The episode is aptly titled “Gathering” because the who group has finally regrouped in order to take down Daki and Gyutaro. 
            It was really great to see Inosuke and Zenitsu in roles beyond just comic relief. The moments in the series when they get to 
            show their heroic sides are always enjoyable to watch. There is a reason Tanjiro, Inosuke, and Zenitsu were brought along to help Uzui, 
            which we really get to see in this episode. It's clear that Uzui can't win the battle on his own, since Daki and Gyutaro have 
            killed several Hashira before, but the trio of heroes are more than able to hold their own at the start of this battle. 
            It's entirely believable that they will be able to help Uzui defeat the Upper Rank demons, although we will have to wait at least 
            another week to find out.

            What is most fascinating to me is how every week seems to raise the impossibly high bar for the quality of animation. 
            The fighting in the series has been top-notch from day one, and it is absolutely mind-boggling that ufotable is able to 
            improve the visuals week in and week out. There are some truly insane moves showcased in this episode, and they are impeccably brought to life. 
            I audibly gasped at least twice in the episode, and we haven't even reached the finale of the battle! I can't even begin to 
            imagine what we are going to see next week.
