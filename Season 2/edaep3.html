            Demon Slayer: Entertainment District Arc Episode 3 sees Tanjiro and the others continue to search for the three wives of Uzui. 
            As they search their respective targets for the women, they begin to see signs of the demon that is threatening the entertainment 
            district. But will they be able to put the pieces together in time?

            Opening this week's episode is a confrontation that kicks off this week's story wonderfully on so many levels. 
            From the gorgeous grainy black and white look of the sequence, which somehow makes the already striking visual design Demon Slayer 
            has always been known for even more so, to the way it builds up the chilling energy surrounding the demon plaguing the entertainment 
            district, this opening does so much in its short time. One of the best opening moments I've seen in an anime this year.

            From this opening, Entertainment District Arc Episode 3 joins our heroes as they continue to search their respective houses 
            for the missing women. These sequences deliver a well-balanced blend of humor and tension. Inosuke's big sequence in this episode
             delivers the high point of this story's tension. As he pursues a lead through his designated house, the character's emotion 
             combines with the presentation of the external situation to truly convey the stress the character is under as they pursue their target. While this sequence shines in the Entertainment District Arc Episode 3, Zenitsuâ€™s sequence struggles a bit more.

            The final area of this episode's story that must be mentioned is when the narrative elaborates on the demon. 
            The character is delivered in a way that seems to increase its chilling presence every time it graces the screen.
             The atmosphere built around this villain is flawless. Between the power that the character brings to the screen itself, 
             coupled with the reinforcement of this presence by those around it and you have some magnificent character building on the part 
             of this story's main villain.
