            Anime (Japanese: アニメ is hand-drawn and computer animation originating from Japan. 
            In Japan and in Japanese, anime (a term derived from the English word animation) describes all animated works, 
            regardless of style or origin. However, outside of Japan and in English, anime is colloquial for Japanese animation 
            and refers specifically to animation produced in Japan.
            Animation produced outside of Japan with similar style to Japanese animation is referred to as anime-influenced animation.

            The earliest commercial Japanese animations date to 1917. 
            A characteristic art style emerged in the 1960s with the works of cartoonist Osamu Tezuka and spread in following decades, 
            developing a large domestic audience. 
            Anime is distributed theatrically, through television broadcasts, directly to home media, and over the Internet. 
            In addition to original works, anime are often adaptations of Japanese comics (manga), light novels, or video games. 
            It is classified into numerous genres targeting various broad and niche audiences.

            Anime is a diverse medium with distinctive production methods that have adapted in response to emergent technologies. 
            It combines graphic art, characterization, cinematography, and other forms of imaginative and individualistic techniques.
            Compared to Western animation, anime production generally focuses less on movement, and more on the detail of settings 
            and use of "camera effects", such as panning, zooming, and angle shots.Diverse art styles are used, and character proportions and 
            features can be quite varied, with a common characteristic feature being large and emotive eyes.
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            The anime industry consists of over 430 production companies, including major studios like Studio Ghibli, Sunrise, Ufotable, 
            CoMix Wave Films and Toei Animation. 
            Since the 1980s, the medium has also seen international success with the rise of foreign dubbed, subtitled programming and 
            its increasing distribution through streaming services. 
            As of 2016, Japanese anime accounted for 60% of the world's animated television shows.

            Anime differs greatly from other forms of animation by its diverse art styles, methods of animation, its production, and its process. 
            Visually, anime works exhibit a wide variety of art styles, differing between creators, artists, and studios.
            While no single art style predominates anime as a whole, they do share some similar attributes in terms of animation technique and character design. 
        </div>
        <h3 class="para-detail">Technique</h3>
        <div class="para">
            Modern anime follows a typical animation production process, involving storyboarding, voice acting, character design, and cel production. 
            Since the 1990s, animators have increasingly used computer animation to improve the efficiency of the production process. 
            Early anime works were experimental, and consisted of images drawn on blackboards, stop motion animation of paper cutouts, and silhouette animation. 
            Cel animation grew in popularity until it came to dominate the medium. 
            In the 21st century, the use of other animation techniques is mostly limited to independent short films,
            including the stop motion puppet animation work produced by Tadahito Mochinaga, Kihachirō Kawamoto and Tomoyasu Murata.
            Computers were integrated into the animation process in the 1990s, with works such as Ghost in the Shell and Princess Mononoke 
            mixing cel animation with computer-generated images.
            Fuji Film, a major cel production company, announced it would stop cel production,
            producing an industry panic to procure cel imports and hastening the switch to digital processes.
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            Prior to the digital era, anime was produced with traditional animation methods using a pose to pose approach.
            The majority of mainstream anime uses fewer expressive key frames and more in-between animation.
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            Japanese animation studios were pioneers of many limited animation techniques, and have given anime a distinct set of conventions. 
            Unlike Disney animation, where the emphasis is on the movement, anime emphasizes the art quality and let limited animation techniques 
            make up for the lack of time spent on movement. Such techniques are often used not only to meet deadlines but also as artistic devices.
            Anime scenes place emphasis on achieving three-dimensional views, and backgrounds are instrumental in creating the atmosphere of the work.
            The backgrounds are not always invented and are occasionally based on real locations, as exemplified in Howl's Moving Castle and 
            The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya.
            Oppliger stated that anime is one of the rare mediums where putting together an all-star cast usually comes out looking "tremendously impressive".

            The cinematic effects of anime differentiates itself from the stage plays found in American animation. 
            Anime is cinematically shot as if by camera, including panning, zooming, distance and angle shots to more complex dynamic shots 
            that would be difficult to produce in reality.
            In anime, the animation is produced before the voice acting, contrary to American animation which does the voice acting first.
        </div>
        <h3 class="para-detail">Characters</h3>
        <div class="para">
            The body proportions of human anime characters tend to accurately reflect the proportions of the human body in reality. 
            The height of the head is considered by the artist as the base unit of proportion. 
            Head heights can vary, but most anime characters are about seven to eight heads tall.
            Anime artists occasionally make deliberate modifications to body proportions to produce super deformed characters that feature 
            a disproportionately small body compared to the head; many super deformed characters are two to four heads tall. 
            Some anime works like Crayon Shin-chan completely disregard these proportions, in such a way that they resemble caricatured Western cartoons.
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            A common anime character design convention is exaggerated eye size. 
            The animation of characters with large eyes in anime can be traced back to Osamu Tezuka, 
            who was deeply influenced by such early animation characters as Betty Boop, who was drawn with disproportionately large eyes.
            Tezuka is a central figure in anime and manga history, whose iconic art style and character designs 
            allowed for the entire range of human emotions to be depicted solely through the eyes.
            The artist adds variable color shading to the eyes and particularly to the cornea to give them greater depth. 
            Generally, a mixture of a light shade, the tone color, and a dark shade is used.
            Cultural anthropologist Matt Thorn argues that Japanese animators and audiences do not perceive such stylized eyes 
            as inherently more or less foreign.
            However, not all anime characters have large eyes. 
            For example, the works of Hayao Miyazaki are known for having realistically proportioned eyes, as well as realistic hair colors on their characters.
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            Hair in anime is often unnaturally lively and colorful or uniquely styled. 
            The movement of hair in anime is exaggerated and "hair action" is used to emphasize the action and emotions of characters for added visual effect. 
            Poitras traces hairstyle color to cover illustrations on manga, where eye-catching artwork and colorful tones are attractive for children's manga. 
            Despite being produced for a domestic market, anime features characters whose race or nationality is not always defined, 
            and this is often a deliberate decision, such as in the Pokémon animated series.
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            Anime and manga artists often draw from a common canon of iconic facial expression illustrations to denote particular moods and thoughts.
            These techniques are often different in form than their counterparts in Western animation, 
            and they include a fixed iconography that is used as shorthand for certain emotions and moods. 
            For example, a male character may develop a nosebleed when aroused. 
            A variety of visual symbols are employed, including sweat drops to depict nervousness, visible blushing for embarrassment, or glowing eyes for an intense glare.
            Another recurring sight gag is the use of chibi (deformed, simplified character designs) figures to comedically punctuate emotions like confusion or embarrassment.
