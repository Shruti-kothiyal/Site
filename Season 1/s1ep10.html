            As Yahaba starts to disintegrate, he pummels Tanjiro with his arrows, trying to take him with him, 
            forcing Tanjiro to first unleash the 
            <b>Water Breathing, Fourth Form: Striking Tide then the Second Form: Water Wheel, then Drop Ripple Thrust, Curve, Water Surface Slash and Whirlpool</b> 
            to soften the impact. 
            Yahaba finally dies but Tanjiro is left so exhausted he can only crawl to where Nezuko and the others are fighting.

            Thanks to medicine given to her by Tamayo, Nezuko rejoins the fight against Susamaru and Nezuko's will sharpens her strength, 
            letting her kick Susamaru's temari back without being hurt. 
            Susamaru materializes six temari at once to attack her but Tamayo asks her if she knows how cowardly Kibutsuji is, 
            as he programmed his demons with the instinct to kill each other so they won't band together and kill him, enraging Susamaru.

            She doesn't notice Tamayo is casting a Spell - Blood Demon Art, Blood Bewitchment: Magical Aroma of Daylight, which weakens brain function. 
            Susamaru says Kibutsuji's name, triggering a curse (as the demons aren't supposed to say his name) and is killed when giant arms burst 
            from her body and crush her as Tanjiro watches.

        <div class="para">
            Tamayo states she wasn't one of the Twelve Kizuki as they have numbers engraved on their eyeballs, and Susamaru and Yahaba are simply too weak. 
            Tamayo takes some of Susamaru's blood.

            Tanjiro returns to the house and finds Nezuko in the basement away from the sunlight, where she hugs Tamayo and rubs Yushiro's head, 
            seeing the two demons as humans, which is why she protected them. Tamayo begins to cry at that and thanks Nezuko. 
            Tamayo and Yushiro make plans to leave the area as they're too close to Kibutsuji.

            A Kasugai crow appears to Tanjiro after he leaves, directing him to the south-east. While Tanjiro tries to quiet the crow, he sees a young blonde man, 
            one of the other three who completed the Final Selection with him, Zenitsu Agatsuma, begging a distressed woman to marry him.
