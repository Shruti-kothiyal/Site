            Tanjiro buys a straw basket, planning to carry Nezuko in it so they can keep heading to Mt. Sagiri during the day and keep her out of the sun. 
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            Urokodaki returns and, two years after Nezuko's transformation, Tanjiro leaves for the Final Selection, 
            with the still sleeping Nezuko staying with Urokodaki. 
            Before he leaves, he warns Tanjiro that older demons who have consumed more humans more develop new powers 
            and gives him a fox mask with a spell to protect him. Tanjiro tells Urokodaki to say hello to Sabito and Makomo for him, 
            startling Urokodaki, who wonders how he knows the names of those dead children. 
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            Upon reaching Mt. Fujikasane, Tanjiro sees wisteria blooming and a number of other teenagers. 
            The group is greeted by a pair of girls, who tell them many demons are imprisoned on the mountain, 
            unable to leave because the wisteria they hate blooms year-round at the base. 
            From this point on there is no wisteria and only those who survive for seven days will pass. 
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            Tanjiro is soon ambushed by two hungry demons but uses the Water Breathing, Fourth Form: Striking Tide to kill both of them with a special 
            "Nichirin Sword" Urokodaki gave him. He detects a rotten smell and sees another applicant being chased by a massive demon. 
            The applicant is caught but Tanjiro saves him with the <b>Water Breathing, Second Form: Water Wheel</b>. 
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            The demon asks Tanjiro for the year and is enraged when he learns he has been trapped here so long it has passed into another era.
             He curses Urokodaki for capturing him. 
            The applicant can't believe the demon is so old as there should only be young ones who have only killed two or three here, 
            but this one has eaten at least fifty applicants. 
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            The demon says Tanjiro will be the 14th student of Urokodaki he's eaten, recognizing him by the style of mask. 
            The demon recalls eating Sabito and Makomo and Tanjiro attacks him, enraged. 
            Sabito and Makomo's ghosts sit on the slashed boulder, wondering if Tanjiro can defeat their killer. 
            The applicant Tanjiro saved flees.
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            Tanjiro targets the demon's weak spot, his neck, but the demon thinks his neck is too strong to break as Sabito broke his sword trying to cut it. 
            Tanjiro's strike however, severs the neck with him using the <b>Water Breathing, First Form: Water Surface Slash</b>.
