            Inosuke Hashibira, the boar-headed young man, launches reckless attacks against the drum demon, Kyogai, but can't compensate for his Blood Demon Art. 
            When he steps on Teruko after the room shifts and Tanjiro throws him back, Inosuke declares a human's never thrown him like that and attacks Tanjiro, laughing. 
            He states he chipped his swords so they would shred flesh, instead of neatly slice it like Tanjiro's. 
            However, the room spins and Inosuke falls out of it. 
            The rooms shift at the sound of a tsuzumi drum, though the demon doesn't strike his, separating Tanjiro, Inosuke, and the demon. 
            Tanjiro detects a scent that leads him and Teruko to a terrified human boy with a tsuzumi drum.

            Zenitsu is walking with Shoichi and screams fearfully when Shoichi breaks the silence to tell him he's acting so scared it's scaring him. 
            The scream draws out a second demon that chases them. Zenitsu eventually faints. While asleep, he stands and uses the Thunder Breathing, 
            First Form: Thunderclap and Flash to kill the demon. He then wakes up with no memory of doing so and thinks Shoichi killed it.

            Inosuke comes across a third demon but effortlessly kills him with his self-made <strong>Breathing, Third Fang: Devour</strong> .

            Kyogai had kidnapped the siblings' brother because wants to eat his marechi, a human with rare blood who is worth more to a demon nutritionally, 
            hoping to gain enough power to return to being one of the Twelve Kizuki. Kibutsuji had earlier decided he'd reached his limit and stripped him of his number. 
            Tanjiro and Teruko find the boy in a room, and realize that he's indeed their brother, Kiyoshi. 
            He embraces Teruko and tells Tanjiro the three demons fought over who would eat him and one of Kyogai's drums was torn out in the skirmish. 
            When Kiyoshi hit it, it moved him to another room and he's been switching rooms anytime he hears someone approached. 
            Realizing Kyogai is coming, Tanjiro tells the siblings to keep switching rooms when someone approaches - he will track them by their scent.

        <div class="para">
            They switch rooms after he leaves it to attack Kyogai, who begins flipping the room and using an attack that leaves claw-like gouges on the floor. 
            Tanjiro has learned each drum controls one function (the drum in his right shoulder flips the room to his right and so on), and is able to partially compensate, 
            but can't get close enough with Kyogai's claw attack, some of his bones still broken. 
            While he's afraid, Tanjiro declares he'll never give up.
