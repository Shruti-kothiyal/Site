            Susamaru uses two temari balls to destroy the protective barrier of the house, which she begins to pummel. 
            Nezuko takes the wounded human woman to the basement while Tanjiro faces them, having learned he is their target from Susamaru's taunting. 
            Susamaru states she and her companion are two of the Twelve Kizuki, powerful generals who serve directly under Kibutsuji. 
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            Susamaru grows two more sets of arms and her temari multiply so she now has six. 
            Tanjiro struggles to dodge all of them as they have the ability to swerve in midair. 
            Yushiro tells Tanjiro to dodge the arrows and puts a Blood Demon Art: Blindfold on him when Tanjiro states he can't see any. 
            He can then see Yahaba is using arrows to telekinetically control the trajectory of the temari balls and the siblings go outside.  
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            Nezuko attacks Yahaba, which makes him lose concentration and weakens the temari balls, 
            letting Tanjiro destroy them and cut off Susamaru's arms by using the <b>Water Breathing, Third Form: Flowing Dance</b>. 
            Susamaru regrows her arms and creates six more temari balls. 
            Yahaba uses his telekinesis to knock Nezuko into Tanjiro and both siblings land in a heap. 
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            Tanjiro focuses on Yahaba while Nezuko, Tamayo, and Yushiro fight Susamaru. 
            Yahaba uses his telekinesis to throw Tanjiro around the courtyard, who can't get close. 
            Yushiro uses his Blood Demon Art to turn invisible and pummel Susamaru. 
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            The demons then recognize Tamayo as "the fugitive" and start to go after her too, while Nezuko loses a leg when she tries to kick a temari. 
            Yahaba uses his arrows to alter Tanjiro's trajectory even if he gets close and Tanjiro struggles to dodge the arrows, which he can't cut. 
            Touching them results in his sword moving in the direction of the arrow.  
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            Tanjiro finally uses the <b>Water Breathing, Sixth Form: Twisting Whirlpool</b>, 
            Flowing Water to move the arrows without touching them and decapitates Yahaba with the 
            <b>Water Breathing, Second Form: Improved, Lateral Water Wheel</b>.
