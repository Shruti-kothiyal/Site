            Tanjiro Kamado, a young boy with a gifted sense of smell, leaves his family in their mountain home and departs to a nearby town to sell charcoal. 
            His family has struggled financially since the death of their father but they are happy nonetheless. When Tanjiro arrives at the town, 
            they welcome him and does small tasks to help the townspeople. By the time he has sold all the charcoal, night time has already fallen.

            As he heads home, Saburo, an elderly man who has lost his family, sternly instructs Tanjiro to spend the night in his home. 
            He warns Tanjiro to never travel at night, since there are man-eating Demons roaming the land.

            When Tanjiro returns home the following morning, he smells blood and discovers his entire family has been massacred. 
            He finds that his younger sister, Nezuko, is still warm to the touch and he tries to take her to the town for medical treatment. 
            Tanjiro slips and falls into the snow back, but when he tries to carry Nezuko again, she transforms into a demon and attacks him.

            While Tanjiro tries to fend her off, a Demon Slayer—whose name is later revealed to be Giyu Tomioka—arrives and attempts to decapitate Nezuko, 
            only for Tanjiro to pull her out of the way. He pleads with Giyu that Nezuko would never harm anyone, and that there was an unknown scent at his home 
            who might've been the culprit. However Giyu dismisses his excuses, and explains that Nezuko had transformed into a demon 
            after her wounds were contaminated with demon blood, and that she is hungry demon who will eat humans. Tanjiro says that he will cure Nezuko 
            and begs to have her life spared, but this infuriates Giyu, causing him to berate Tanjiro for his weak demeanor and resolve.

            Giyu stabs Nezuko which causes Tanjiro to take action, he tries his best to attack him but is ultimately knocked unconscious. 
            When Nezuko sees Tanjiro lying unconscious at her feet, Nezuko escapes from Giyu's grasp and runs to him, 
            Giyu looks on in despair as he believes that she is going to eat him, but is stunned to see that she's protecting her brother from him. 
            Nezuko attacks Giyu but he questions her odd behavior, and ends up knocking her unconscious instead of killing her.

            Tanjiro dreams of his family apologizing for leaving him, and his mother entrusting him to look after Nezuko.

            He instructs Tanjiro to say that he was the one who sent them, and warns him to make sure that Nezuko is never exposed to sunlight before vanishing. 
            The siblings return home to bury the rest of the Kamado family, and leave hand in hand to embark on their journey.
